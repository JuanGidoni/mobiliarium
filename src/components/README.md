# Header implementation with Nav

We createda a Header component with navigation links using [react-router-dom].

The steps:

1. Header Component:
   This includes the app title and links to [/], [/categoria/animales], and [/filtros].
2. Integration in App.jsx:
   So that Header is present in all pages.
3. Router Configuration:
   Wrap App with [BrowserRouter] in [main.jsx].
4. Styling:
   Use [styles.css] for Header design and link styles.

The Outcome:
Navigation changes routes without page reload, and Header visible.
